Kubernetes log extractor written in GO. Blazing fast. ðŸ”¥

## Overview

`klogs` is fast Kubernetes log extractor written in Go. It simplifies the process of extracting logs from Kubernetes clusters, making it easier for developers and operations teams to monitor and debug applications running in Kubernetes environments.

## Features

- **Efficient Log Extraction**: Quickly collect logs from Kubernetes pods even if the pod has multiple containers.
- **Namespace Support**: Allows targeting logs within specific namespaces.
- **Label Filtering**: Extract logs from pods matching specific labels.
- **Multiple-Pods Log Download**: Supports downloading logs from multiple pods simultaneously, enhancing efficiency when dealing with large-scale deployments.
- **Output Flexibility**: Saves logs to a specified directory or outputs to date-based folder.

## Installation

  klogs [flags]

Flags:
      --kubeconfig string [optional]   absolute path to the kubeconfig file

  -n, --namespace string  [optional]  Select namespace
  -l, --label stringArray [optional]  Select label (or labels with multiple -l flags)
  -r, --reverse boolean   [optional]  Write logs in reverse order (date descending)
````

* If no namespace is provided, the command will use the current context in the kubeconfig file.
* If no label is provided, the command will list all pods in the namespace and prompt the user to select one.
* If logpath is provided, the logs will be saved to that path instead of the default logs/ directory.

### Examples
